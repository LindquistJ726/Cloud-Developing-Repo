# Cloud-Developing-Repo
A repository for code I've made for my Cloud Developing Class at Macomb Community College

This repository was made for me to post the code I've developed for a Cloud Developing Class at Macomb Community College.
I plan on updating it regularly with new projects from this class to document what I've developed.
Currently within this repository there is 3 .py files that contain pass assignments.

The first assignment is a AWS DynamoDB python program used to create a table and modify it.
This program also has the ability to modify a local DynamoDB housed in Doker or AWS.

The second assignment is Python program that can get and post to an API.
It will print the results of the call and also any information that comes from it.
I hard coded JSONplaceholder examples in the code to test but it can be modified to function with other webpages.

The third assignment is a program that is use to put a program into AWS Lambda.
The python program I put in is a basic DynamoDB put_item function, as the main focus was Lambda.
The program will print results depending on success or failure.
